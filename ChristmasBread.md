# AUNTIE LENA'S SWEDISH COFFEE BREAD
## Christmas Bread in my house, a must with the stocking orange on Christmas morning!

Makes 2 loaves.
ALWAYS double it....you can freeze unbaked loaves, just freeze before final rising


* 2 cups hot milk
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup shortening (LARD or BUTTER)
* 2 cups flour (plus lots more later)
* 1/2 tsp. salt 15 cardamom seeds
* 1 yeast cake or pkg.
* 1 egg

1. Remove seeds from cardamoms and pound fine.
2. Add to hot milk with shortening, sugar and salt.
3. When lukewarm, add yeast mixed with a little tepid water.
4. Add flour.  Mix and allow to rise.
5. Then, add egg and more flour, a couple of cups at least, to make a stiff dough.
6. Knead.
7. Let rise again.
8. When double in bulk, shape into loaves or rolls (I like to braid them)
9. Let rise again.
10. Bake at 350 degrees until done (1/2 hr. to 45 min.)

>  Today is 1/2/12, kinda cool! Saw many of you yesterday at Peggy's, and many of you I did not see, but think of all my extended family often.  It is funny how much life chapters change, and I realize how luck I was to have so much family close together for so long.  I started thinking yesterday about how much gets lost along the way, and this morning thought maybe e-mail would be a simple, uncomplicated way to try and do a little sharing.  Thnk you, Judy for all the genealogy work....got me thinkin' about Mom's side, too, and the stories that should not be lost as the Big Bang keeps us spinning further apart.....
> 
> One thing I thought about a lot over the holidays was how much I LOVE gardens and recipes.  I have plants in my garden that came to me from Grandma Ann.  I have plants in Maine and at Jersy St. that came from Grandma Dot.  This summer I planted raspberries that Peggy gave me that came from Grandma's Village St. yard.  I have Baby's breath Peggy gave me from Grandma Dot, and blueberries from Peggy!  I hope to get some more mallow from Clarissa....maybe globe thistle, too!  Over the past few weeks I baked 2 batches of Joe Froggers.....which go WAY back to Black Joe, of Black Joe's Tavern, Black Joe's Pond and Gingerbread Hill....who was also a free black man, and Revolutionary war hero, married a Cree Indian and ran a tavern.....Baked one batch with my sisters....thought about eating Joe Froggers (Baked with LARD, not BUTTER) at Gregory Street.  Baked Auntie Lena's Swedish Christmas Bread......talked to Peggy yesterday about who is Auntie Lena anyway, and how is she our aunt.....and Peggy did not have that recipe......Anyhoo, we live on in our plants and recipes and the stories we share with each other!
> 
> So.....I am going to share Auntie Lena's recipe with you all, though some of you may have it.  I think we decided she was Great-(Great)-Grandpa John A. Ohman's sister(?) please, anyone, straighten me out here....and Bill started to share a story about Uncle John and John A....hope he will send it e-mail!?  So, John A. was Grandma Dot's father, I do not know his wife's name, but he was very scary to me and missing fingers, sat in a chair in his driveway.....He had 3 girls, Mimi, the wild one, Dot (Dorothy) the other wild one, and Hazel...."the Girl Scout," Mimi called her.  Grandpa George lived on Evan's Road across the street from these girls.  Now, Dot grew up, quit school in 8th grade....there's a good story about THAT, too.  She married George and had two kids, Grandma Ann and Uncle John.
> 
> I would LOVE to know more about those Wolfgram boys, too...George, Roy and Harold....don't know order or much!
> 
> So, before I sit here all day, here is the recipe I came on to share....and am very happy to share Joe Froggers, or Monkey-Faces or any others I have, as well as share (or accept) plants and stories and recipes!

> So, that's it for now, but hope the New Year finds everyone healthy and happy and I send lotsa LOVE to you all!!!
